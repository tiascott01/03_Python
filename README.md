# 03_Python_Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains two folders for activities PyBank and PyPoll for analyzing and summarizing CSV data into Python. The directions for the module were to create separate folders for each activity, including a resources folder (for storing the original CSV file), and an analysis folder, which stored the output of the Python file as a .txt format. Additionally in the Analysis folder, I included screenshots of the print from my terminal as part of the final analysis and completion of this challenge.

## Results

In the 03_Python_Challenge, you will find separate folders for both PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder has a separate Resources and Analysis folder, those containing the corresponding CSV file and the output text-based anaylsis. There are also images inside the analysis folder representing the results from my personal terminal. Each folder also contains the "main.py" file as main file for this script.

## Usage

You can use these scripts to analyze the data in the corresponding resource CSV.

1. Open the respective Python script (`Main.py) for either PyBank or PyPoll activity.

2. Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.

3. Run the python script (`Main.py).

4. The results will be displayed in the terminal as per the module3 instruction photos and will also print a .txt file to the analysis folder.
